# Fintech Bootcamp Project 1
## Building a Portfolio Monitor for NFT Holdings

#### NFT Holdings can vary widely across chains, platforms and types. How does one monitor and track their holdings?
- Our goal is to research datasets around these digital assets and do the following:
    - Create a taxonomy that works across chains/asset types
    - Create a series of value metrics
    - Build a set of visualization tools to create a dashboard view of holdings


In the first iteration of this project, we intend to source a static dataset representing a single asset collection. This will allow us to achieve our primary of objectives of understanding the data and how to clean and analyze it.
